We also provided the support site - https://help.pearsoncmg.com/xl/instructor/instructor_help/Content/submit_scores_incompletes.htm to the instructor for review; however, the EDU continues to insist that there is something wrong with their gradebook and assignment settings that is why we decided to escalate the case for further review.</td>

      <td>We understand that this is FAD. This case originated from FS, where the FS team and FS Specialist explained to the EDU that students receive a score of zero due to the settings applied to the assignments, even though they have not completed them yet. Despite this explanation, the EDU insisted that there are some technical issues with the assignments or gradebook. As a result, the FS team decided to escalate the case to TS as the FS Specialist mentioned that they have seen similar case escalated to TS.\n\nFrom the Tier 2 side, we've reviewed the support site before I escalate the case, though I was not able to mention that the EDU needs to uncheck the box each time they manage incompletes and point out that the EDU has the option to delete the zero scores. But we were able to inform the EDU that this is working as designed. We also provided the support site - https://help.pearsoncmg.com/xl/instructor/instructor_help/Content/submit_scores_incompletes.htm to the instructor for review; however, the EDU continues to insist that there is something wrong with their gradebook and assignment settings that is why we decided to escalate the case for further review.</td>

This case originated from FS, where the FS team and FS Specialist explained to the EDU that students receive a score of zero due to the settings applied to the assignments, even though they have not completed them yet. Despite this explanation, the EDU insisted that there are some technical issues with the assignments or gradebook. As a result, the FS team decided to escalate the case to TS as the FS Specialist mentioned that they have seen similar case escalated to TS.\n\nFrom the Tier 2 side, we've reviewed the support site before I escalate the case, though I was not able to mention that the EDU needs to uncheck the box each time they manage incompletes and point out that the EDU has the option to delete the zero scores. But we were able to inform the EDU that this is working as designed. We also provided the support site - https://help.pearsoncmg.com/xl/instructor/instructor_help/Content/submit_scores_incompletes.htm to the instructor for review; however, the EDU continues to insist that there is something wrong with their gradebook and assignment settings that is why we decided to escalate the case for further review.</td>

For Quiz 1.6 I see student submissions from the date Sept 3 all the way through Sept 12. If the student's are claiming to not have a start button they would need to report the issue and make sure the assignment is available to start.

Each time they click the check answer or final check button, that counts as a try. When they click try again, that counts as a new attempt, so they get two tries to answer the questions with each of the 10 attempts the instructor has provided.

Each time they click the check answer or final check button, that counts as a try. When they click try again, that counts as a new attempt, so they get two tries to answer the questions with each of the 10 attempts the instructor has provided.

Unfortunately to my knowledge there is no way to retroactively fix the Canvas gradebook but that would be a question for the school Canvas admin or Canvas support.  If this is still happening on future assignments that haven't been completed yet  and the grades sync automatically please give us one student and the exercise so that we can look into this.  The Revel and Learning Management System team are aware that submission time aren't sent to the LMS and the sync time is what is view by the Learning Management System as the "submit time" and can cause this issue.  Unfortunately I do not have an ETA on when this will be changed but it is something the teams are working diligently on.</td>
