<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> resolving - please assist the user </p>
<p><strong>FAD Reason:</strong> SUPPORT - this is #FAD and the student must remove Screencastify from Chrome by removing the extension. Removing extensions from Chrome can be done within the Chrome browser locally. Please assist the user with local technical support troubleshooting - if you are unable to do so you might refer the student to Respondus technical support.

Additional NO troubleshooting was done in 50302264 - that case is resolved because the student successfully accessed the test, I would assume after disabling the interfering application from Chrome, no action was taken by OCC since it was a local technical issue.</p>

<h3>Mastering Genetics - Submit zeros for students who did not start the assignment/Manage Incompletes</h3>
<p><strong>Name of agent:</strong> Christopher Bustamante</p>

<p><strong>Team:</strong> T2</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Mastering - Gradebook</p>
<p><strong>Questions/Comments/Notes to raise on CTS/Prod Support Call:</strong> We understand that this is FAD. This case originated from FS, where the FS team and FS Specialist explained to the EDU that students receive a score of zero due to the settings applied to the assignments, even though they have not completed them yet. Despite this explanation, the EDU insisted that there are some technical issues with the assignments or gradebook. As a result, the FS team decided to escalate the case to TS as the FS Specialist mentioned that they have seen similar case escalated to TS.

From the Tier 2 side, we've reviewed the support site before I escalate the case, though I was not able to mention that the EDU needs to uncheck the box each time they manage incompletes and point out that the EDU has the option to delete the zero scores. But we were able to inform the EDU that this is working as designed. We also provided the support site - https://help.pearsoncmg.com/xl/instructor/instructor_help/Content/submit_scores_incompletes.htm to the instructor for review; however, the EDU continues to insist that there is something wrong with their gradebook and assignment settings that is why we decided to escalate the case for further review.</p>

<p><strong>FAD Reason:</strong> This is functioning as designed. The box needs to be unchecked each time the instructor manages incompletes: https://help.pearsoncmg.com/xl/instructor/instructor_help/Content/submit_scores_incompletes.htm. If they would like to delete 0 scores that they did not mean to give to specific students, they can click on those scores in the gradebook, select the dropdown next to the assignment on the next page, and delete the 0 score. However, please caution them that deleting is permanent; therefore, they want to be careful when doing this to avoid deleting any actual scores.</p>

1) Grade Sync Settings - This is where the instructor can set to sync grades to the LMS
2) Change Weights and Categories - Any assignments set to 'omit' will not send to the LMS.

The code showing in the description of the ticket is: IBRA-THUNK-PILCH-FLYTE-ELVIS-GIBES which is an old access code for standalone eText which we don't offer anymore.

Once the Omit Results is turned off those items will flow into the "Instructor Self-Service" link area > Grade Sync where sync can then be confirmed for all items. Once the graded items flow to the ISS > Grade Sync area, and the applicable items have been marked for sync and they read "Enabled", those will then appear in the D2L gradebook. Please reopen if this does not resolve the grade sync issues.

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> It appears that the student encountered a Late Penalty when they completed the work on September 3rd and 4th for these assignments on the MyLab side. The due dates have been extended for these assignments - so the student should relaunch them and save them one time. This should retrigger the grading aspect and recognize the new due date - which should eliminate the late penalty.

If this does not correct the issue - please provide a screenshot of what the LMS gradebook is showing.</p>

The lineItemContainer collection in SOCKET DB is where all assignments are stored with the relevant information. As this still has "status" : "RECEIVED", meaning it hasn't been delivered, I checked the gradeSetting collection; which has the sync details, and can see that this is set to automatic, but specific assignments. The list doesn't include the assignments they have mentioned are missing from the LMS gradebook.

Please work with the instructor to select the assignments they wish to sync from the instructor dashboard > grade sync tab and then run the manual grade sync.</p>

This student is enrolled in MLM course id: hodgson35399 that has similar code (ITC 2016 - FALL 2024 90421) to course name name form student diagnostics, but this is non integrated course so would be accessible via mlm.pearson.com with Pearson username.

If instructor wants to use LMS integration:
1. they need to link to new copy (they can copy hodgson35399)
2. Ask students to join from LMS using the same Pearson username
3. Import student progress if needed form hodgson35399

There is nothing we can assist here - if instructor needs help with any of the steps above CTS or Faculty Support can help.</p>

It sounds like there is some confusion between tries and attempts here. The students are getting two tries and 10 attempts. Each time they click the check answer or final check button, that counts as a try. When they click try again, that counts as a new attempt, so they get two tries to answer the questions with each of the 10 attempts the instructor has provided. You can learn more by reviewing this help file: https://support.pearson.com/getsupport/s/document-item?bundleId=Tries-vs-attempts-in-MyLab-and-Mastering&topicId=Tries_vs_Attempts.html&_LANG=enus.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> This is not a technical error - the school is applied to the instructors account based on what they've entered during registration. This can also be updated by you within the XL Admin tool if they do not have the proper school listed on their account.

Instructors can also use the Change option to select a different school if the course they are looking for does not show up.

The fact that there are variances in the school names - will need to be addressed locally to ensure the users all select the same school to share their assignments.

We have updated the list provided to Beverly Public School District - so all the users should see each others courses when selecting that option.</p>

<p><strong>FAD Reason:</strong> SUPPORT - this is #FAD and the student must remove Screencastify from Chrome by removing the extension. Removing extensions from Chrome can be done within the Chrome browser locally. Please assist the user with local technical support troubleshooting - if you are unable to do so you might refer the student to Respondus technical support.

Additional NO troubleshooting was done in 50302264 - that case is resolved because the student successfully accessed the test, I would assume after disabling the interfering application from Chrome, no action was taken by OCC since it was a local technical issue.</p>

<h3>Mastering Genetics - Submit zeros for students who did not start the assignment/Manage Incompletes</h3>

<p><strong>Category:</strong> Mastering - Gradebook</p>
<p><strong>Questions/Comments/Notes to raise on CTS/Prod Support Call:</strong> We understand that this is FAD. This case originated from FS, where the FS team and FS Specialist explained to the EDU that students receive a score of zero due to the settings applied to the assignments, even though they have not completed them yet. Despite this explanation, the EDU insisted that there are some technical issues with the assignments or gradebook. As a result, the FS team decided to escalate the case to TS as the FS Specialist mentioned that they have seen similar case escalated to TS.

From the Tier 2 side, we've reviewed the support site before I escalate the case, though I was not able to mention that the EDU needs to uncheck the box each time they manage incompletes and point out that the EDU has the option to delete the zero scores. But we were able to inform the EDU that this is working as designed. We also provided the support site - https://help.pearsoncmg.com/xl/instructor/instructor_help/Content/submit_scores_incompletes.htm to the instructor for review; however, the EDU continues to insist that there is something wrong with their gradebook and assignment settings that is why we decided to escalate the case for further review.</p>

If they would like to delete 0 scores that they did not mean to give to specific students, they can click on those scores in the gradebook, select the dropdown next to the assignment on the next page, and delete the 0 score. However, please caution them that deleting is permanent; therefore, they want to be careful when doing this to avoid deleting any actual scores.</p>

1) Grade Sync Settings - This is where the instructor can set to sync grades to the LMS
2) Change Weights and Categories - Any assignments set to 'omit' will not send to the LMS.

The code showing in the description of the ticket is: IBRA-THUNK-PILCH-FLYTE-ELVIS-GIBES which is an old access code for standalone eText which we don't offer anymore. This code can only be used for instructor led eText, but that requires an invite link from their instructor to redeem the code. </p>

Once the Omit Results is turned off those items will flow into the "Instructor Self-Service" link area > Grade Sync where sync can then be confirmed for all items. Once the graded items flow to the ISS > Grade Sync area, and the applicable items have been marked for sync and they read "Enabled", those will then appear in the D2L gradebook. Please reopen if this does not resolve the grade sync issues.

Omit Results items are found in the MyLab Gradebook > Change Weights area... </p>

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> It appears that the student encountered a Late Penalty when they completed the work on September 3rd and 4th for these assignments on the MyLab side. The due dates have been extended for these assignments - so the student should relaunch them and save them one time. This should retrigger the grading aspect and recognize the new due date - which should eliminate the late penalty.

If this does not correct the issue - please provide a screenshot of what the LMS gradebook is showing.</p>

The lineItemContainer collection in SOCKET DB is where all assignments are stored with the relevant information. As this still has "status" : "RECEIVED", meaning it hasn't been delivered, I checked the gradeSetting collection; which has the sync details, and can see that this is set to automatic, but specific assignments. The list doesn't include the assignments they have mentioned are missing from the LMS gradebook.

Please work with the instructor to select the assignments they wish to sync from the instructor dashboard > grade sync tab and then run the manual grade sync.</p>

This student is enrolled in MLM course id: hodgson35399 that has similar code (ITC 2016 - FALL 2024 90421) to course name name form student diagnostics, but this is non integrated course so would be accessible via mlm.pearson.com with Pearson username.

If instructor wants to use LMS integration:
1. they need to link to new copy (they can copy hodgson35399)
2. Ask students to join from LMS using the same Pearson username
3. Import student progress if needed form hodgson35399

There is nothing we can assist here - if instructor needs help with any of the steps above CTS or Faculty Support can help.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> Hi Michael,
It sounds like there is some confusion between tries and attempts here. The students are getting two tries and 10 attempts. Each time they click the check answer or final check button, that counts as a try. When they click try again, that counts as a new attempt, so they get two tries to answer the questions with each of the 10 attempts the instructor has provided. You can learn more by reviewing this help file: https://support.pearson.com/getsupport/s/document-item?bundleId=Tries-vs-attempts-in-MyLab-and-Mastering&topicId=Tries_vs_Attempts.html&_LANG=enus.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> This is not a technical error - the school is applied to the instructors account based on what they've entered during registration. This can also be updated by you within the XL Admin tool if they do not have the proper school listed on their account.

Instructors can also use the Change option to select a different school if the course they are looking for does not show up.

The fact that there are variances in the school names - will need to be addressed locally to ensure the users all select the same school to share their assignments.

We have updated the list provided to Beverly Public School District - so all the users should see each others courses when selecting that option.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> resolving - please assist the user </p>
<p><strong>FAD Reason:</strong> SUPPORT - this is #FAD and the student must remove Screencastify from Chrome by removing the extension. Removing extensions from Chrome can be done within the Chrome browser locally. Please assist the user with local technical support troubleshooting - if you are unable to do so you might refer the student to Respondus technical support.

Additional NO troubleshooting was done in 50302264 - that case is resolved because the student successfully accessed the test, I would assume after disabling the interfering application from Chrome, no action was taken by OCC since it was a local technical issue.</p>

<h3>Mastering Genetics - Submit zeros for students who did not start the assignment/Manage Incompletes</h3>

<p><strong>Category:</strong> Mastering - Gradebook</p>
<p><strong>Questions/Comments/Notes to raise on CTS/Prod Support Call:</strong> We understand that this is FAD. This case originated from FS, where the FS team and FS Specialist explained to the EDU that students receive a score of zero due to the settings applied to the assignments, even though they have not completed them yet. Despite this explanation, the EDU insisted that there are some technical issues with the assignments or gradebook. As a result, the FS team decided to escalate the case to TS as the FS Specialist mentioned that they have seen similar case escalated to TS.

From the Tier 2 side, we've reviewed the support site before I escalate the case, though I was not able to mention that the EDU needs to uncheck the box each time they manage incompletes and point out that the EDU has the option to delete the zero scores. But we were able to inform the EDU that this is working as designed. We also provided the support site - https://help.pearsoncmg.com/xl/instructor/instructor_help/Content/submit_scores_incompletes.htm to the instructor for review; however, the EDU continues to insist that there is something wrong with their gradebook and assignment settings that is why we decided to escalate the case for further review.</p>

The box needs to be unchecked each time the instructor manages incompletes: https://help.pearsoncmg.com/xl/instructor/instructor_help/Content/submit_scores_incompletes.htm. If they would like to delete 0 scores that they did not mean to give to specific students, they can click on those scores in the gradebook, select the dropdown next to the assignment on the next page, and delete the 0 score. However, please caution them that deleting is permanent; therefore, they want to be careful when doing this to avoid deleting any actual scores.</p>

1) Grade Sync Settings - This is where the instructor can set to sync grades to the LMS
2) Change Weights and Categories - Any assignments set to 'omit' will not send to the LMS.

Barring the unlikely event that the result was deleted by the instructor, which clearly doesn't seem to be the case here, this student never completed any work on these assignments as is reflected in the Gradebook. This is #FAD</p>

The code showing in the description of the ticket is: IBRA-THUNK-PILCH-FLYTE-ELVIS-GIBES which is an old access code for standalone eText which we don't offer anymore.

Once the Omit Results is turned off those items will flow into the "Instructor Self-Service" link area > Grade Sync where sync can then be confirmed for all items. Once the graded items flow to the ISS > Grade Sync area, and the applicable items have been marked for sync and they read "Enabled", those will then appear in the D2L gradebook. Please reopen if this does not resolve the grade sync issues.

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> #FAD - I'm not clear how we can assist here? If something is missing in LMS (link is not added to course) it is question to instructor on how student should be accessing course material for given section. If instructor was consulted and something is not working after clicking link that should be opening Pearson we need more details - screen recording of the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> It appears that the student encountered a Late Penalty when they completed the work on September 3rd and 4th for these assignments on the MyLab side. The due dates have been extended for these assignments - so the student should relaunch them and save them one time. This should retrigger the grading aspect and recognize the new due date - which should eliminate the late penalty.

If this does not correct the issue - please provide a screenshot of what the LMS gradebook is showing.</p>

The lineItemContainer collection in SOCKET DB is where all assignments are stored with the relevant information. As this still has "status" : "RECEIVED", meaning it hasn't been delivered, I checked the gradeSetting collection; which has the sync details, and can see that this is set to automatic, but specific assignments. The list doesn't include the assignments they have mentioned are missing from the LMS gradebook.

Please work with the instructor to select the assignments they wish to sync from the instructor dashboard > grade sync tab and then run the manual grade sync.</p>

This student is enrolled in MLM course id: hodgson35399 that has similar code (ITC 2016 - FALL 2024 90421) to course name name form student diagnostics, but this is non integrated course so would be accessible via mlm.pearson.com with Pearson username.

If instructor wants to use LMS integration:
1. they need to link to new copy (they can copy hodgson35399)
2. Ask students to join from LMS using the same Pearson username
3. Import student progress if needed form hodgson35399

There is nothing we can assist here - if instructor needs help with any of the steps above CTS or Faculty Support can help.</p>

It sounds like there is some confusion between tries and attempts here. The students are getting two tries and 10 attempts. Each time they click the check answer or final check button, that counts as a try. When they click try again, that counts as a new attempt, so they get two tries to answer the questions with each of the 10 attempts the instructor has provided. You can learn more by reviewing this help file: https://support.pearson.com/getsupport/s/document-item?bundleId=Tries-vs-attempts-in-MyLab-and-Mastering&topicId=Tries_vs_Attempts.html&_LANG=enus.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> This is not a technical error - the school is applied to the instructors account based on what they've entered during registration. This can also be updated by you within the XL Admin tool if they do not have the proper school listed on their account.

Instructors can also use the Change option to select a different school if the course they are looking for does not show up.

The fact that there are variances in the school names - will need to be addressed locally to ensure the users all select the same school to share their assignments.

We have updated the list provided to Beverly Public School District - so all the users should see each others courses when selecting that option.</p>

<p><strong>FAD Reason:</strong> SUPPORT - this is #FAD and the student must remove Screencastify from Chrome by removing the extension. Removing extensions from Chrome can be done within the Chrome browser locally. Please assist the user with local technical support troubleshooting - if you are unable to do so you might refer the student to Respondus technical support.

Additional NO troubleshooting was done in 50302264 - that case is resolved because the student successfully accessed the test, I would assume after disabling the interfering application from Chrome, no action was taken by OCC since it was a local technical issue.</p>

<h3>Mastering Genetics - Submit zeros for students who did not start the assignment/Manage Incompletes</h3>

<p><strong>Questions/Comments/Notes to raise on CTS/Prod Support Call:</strong> We understand that this is FAD. This case originated from FS, where the FS team and FS Specialist explained to the EDU that students receive a score of zero due to the settings applied to the assignments, even though they have not completed them yet. Despite this explanation, the EDU insisted that there are some technical issues with the assignments or gradebook. As a result, the FS team decided to escalate the case to TS as the FS Specialist mentioned that they have seen similar case escalated to TS.

From the Tier 2 side, we've reviewed the support site before I escalate the case, though I was not able to mention that the EDU needs to uncheck the box each time they manage incompletes and point out that the EDU has the option to delete the zero scores. But we were able to inform the EDU that this is working as designed. We also provided the support site - https://help.pearsoncmg.com/xl/instructor/instructor_help/Content/submit_scores_incompletes.htm to the instructor for review; however, the EDU continues to insist that there is something wrong with their gradebook and assignment settings that is why we decided to escalate the case for further review.</p>

If they would like to delete 0 scores that they did not mean to give to specific students, they can click on those scores in the gradebook, select the dropdown next to the assignment on the next page, and delete the 0 score. However, please caution them that deleting is permanent; therefore, they want to be careful when doing this to avoid deleting any actual scores.</p>

1) Grade Sync Settings - This is where the instructor can set to sync grades to the LMS
2) Change Weights and Categories - Any assignments set to 'omit' will not send to the LMS.

<p><strong>FAD Reason:</strong> As you know XL does not keep nor can we provide "activity reports"
As you also know XL logs student work in real time, with protections against loss of work in triplicate

Barring the unlikely event that the result was deleted by the instructor, which clearly doesn't seem to be the case here, this student never completed any work on these assignments as is reflected in the Gradebook. This is #FAD</p>

The code showing in the description of the ticket is: IBRA-THUNK-PILCH-FLYTE-ELVIS-GIBES which is an old access code for standalone eText which we don't offer anymore.

Once the Omit Results is turned off those items will flow into the "Instructor Self-Service" link area > Grade Sync where sync can then be confirmed for all items. Once the graded items flow to the ISS > Grade Sync area, and the applicable items have been marked for sync and they read "Enabled", those will then appear in the D2L gradebook.

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> It appears that the student encountered a Late Penalty when they completed the work on September 3rd and 4th for these assignments on the MyLab side. The due dates have been extended for these assignments - so the student should relaunch them and save them one time. This should retrigger the grading aspect and recognize the new due date - which should eliminate the late penalty.

If this does not correct the issue - please provide a screenshot of what the LMS gradebook is showing.</p>

The lineItemContainer collection in SOCKET DB is where all assignments are stored with the relevant information. As this still has "status" : "RECEIVED", meaning it hasn't been delivered, I checked the gradeSetting collection; which has the sync details, and can see that this is set to automatic, but specific assignments. The list doesn't include the assignments they have mentioned are missing from the LMS gradebook.

Please work with the instructor to select the assignments they wish to sync from the instructor dashboard > grade sync tab and then run the manual grade sync.</p>

This student is enrolled in MLM course id: hodgson35399 that has similar code (ITC 2016 - FALL 2024 90421) to course name name form student diagnostics, but this is non integrated course so would be accessible via mlm.pearson.com with Pearson username.

If instructor wants to use LMS integration:
1. they need to link to new copy (they can copy hodgson35399)
2. Ask students to join from LMS using the same Pearson username
3. Import student progress if needed form hodgson35399

There is nothing we can assist here - if instructor needs help with any of the steps above CTS or Faculty Support can help.</p>

It sounds like there is some confusion between tries and attempts here. The students are getting two tries and 10 attempts. Each time they click the check answer or final check button, that counts as a try. When they click try again, that counts as a new attempt, so they get two tries to answer the questions with each of the 10 attempts the instructor has provided. You can learn more by reviewing this help file: https://support.pearson.com/getsupport/s/document-item?bundleId=Tries-vs-attempts-in-MyLab-and-Mastering&topicId=Tries_vs_Attempts.html&_LANG=enus.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> This is not a technical error - the school is applied to the instructors account based on what they've entered during registration. This can also be updated by you within the XL Admin tool if they do not have the proper school listed on their account.

Instructors can also use the Change option to select a different school if the course they are looking for does not show up.

The fact that there are variances in the school names - will need to be addressed locally to ensure the users all select the same school to share their assignments.

We have updated the list provided to Beverly Public School District - so all the users should see each others courses when selecting that option.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> resolving - please assist the user </p>
<p><strong>FAD Reason:</strong> SUPPORT - this is #FAD and the student must remove Screencastify from Chrome by removing the extension. Removing extensions from Chrome can be done within the Chrome browser locally. Please assist the user with local technical support troubleshooting - if you are unable to do so you might refer the student to Respondus technical support.

Additional NO troubleshooting was done in 50302264 - that case is resolved because the student successfully accessed the test, I would assume after disabling the interfering application from Chrome, no action was taken by OCC since it was a local technical issue.</p>

<h3>Mastering Genetics - Submit zeros for students who did not start the assignment/Manage Incompletes</h3>

<p><strong>Questions/Comments/Notes to raise on CTS/Prod Support Call:</strong> We understand that this is FAD. This case originated from FS, where the FS team and FS Specialist explained to the EDU that students receive a score of zero due to the settings applied to the assignments, even though they have not completed them yet. Despite this explanation, the EDU insisted that there are some technical issues with the assignments or gradebook. As a result, the FS team decided to escalate the case to TS as the FS Specialist mentioned that they have seen similar case escalated to TS.

From the Tier 2 side, we've reviewed the support site before I escalate the case, though I was not able to mention that the EDU needs to uncheck the box each time they manage incompletes and point out that the EDU has the option to delete the zero scores. But we were able to inform the EDU that this is working as designed. We also provided the support site - https://help.pearsoncmg.com/xl/instructor/instructor_help/Content/submit_scores_incompletes.htm to the instructor for review; however, the EDU continues to insist that there is something wrong with their gradebook and assignment settings that is why we decided to escalate the case for further review.</p>

If they would like to delete 0 scores that they did not mean to give to specific students, they can click on those scores in the gradebook, select the dropdown next to the assignment on the next page, and delete the 0 score. However, please caution them that deleting is permanent; therefore, they want to be careful when doing this to avoid deleting any actual scores.</p>

1) Grade Sync Settings - This is where the instructor can set to sync grades to the LMS
2) Change Weights and Categories - Any assignments set to 'omit' will not send to the LMS.

<p><strong>Questions/Comments/Notes to raise on CTS/Prod Support Call:</strong> We understand that this is FAD. However, I have sought assistance with our SME and was advised to advance the case to OCC to still check it if there still a way to check the student activity that's why we escalated the case. Moving forward, we'll make sure to educate the instructor about the XL activity report.</p>

<p><strong>FAD Reason:</strong> As you know XL does not keep nor can we provide "activity reports"
As you also know XL logs student work in real time, with protections against loss of work in triplicate

Barring the unlikely event that the result was deleted by the instructor, which clearly doesn't seem to be the case here, this student never completed any work on these assignments as is reflected in the Gradebook. This is #FAD</p>

The code showing in the description of the ticket is: IBRA-THUNK-PILCH-FLYTE-ELVIS-GIBES which is an old access code for standalone eText which we don't offer anymore. This code can only be used for instructor led eText, but that requires an invite link from their instructor to redeem the code. </p>

Once the graded items flow to the ISS > Grade Sync area, and the applicable items have been marked for sync and they read "Enabled", those will then appear in the D2L gradebook.

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> It appears that the student encountered a Late Penalty when they completed the work on September 3rd and 4th for these assignments on the MyLab side. The due dates have been extended for these assignments - so the student should relaunch them and save them one time. This should retrigger the grading aspect and recognize the new due date - which should eliminate the late penalty.

If this does not correct the issue - please provide a screenshot of what the LMS gradebook is showing.</p>

The lineItemContainer collection in SOCKET DB is where all assignments are stored with the relevant information. As this still has "status" : "RECEIVED", meaning it hasn't been delivered, I checked the gradeSetting collection; which has the sync details, and can see that this is set to automatic, but specific assignments. The list doesn't include the assignments they have mentioned are missing from the LMS gradebook.

Please work with the instructor to select the assignments they wish to sync from the instructor dashboard > grade sync tab and then run the manual grade sync.</p>

This student is enrolled in MLM course id: hodgson35399 that has similar code (ITC 2016 - FALL 2024 90421) to course name name form student diagnostics, but this is non integrated course so would be accessible via mlm.pearson.com with Pearson username.

If instructor wants to use LMS integration:
1. they need to link to new copy (they can copy hodgson35399)
2. Ask students to join from LMS using the same Pearson username
3. Import student progress if needed form hodgson35399

It sounds like there is some confusion between tries and attempts here. The students are getting two tries and 10 attempts. Each time they click the check answer or final check button, that counts as a try. When they click try again, that counts as a new attempt, so they get two tries to answer the questions with each of the 10 attempts the instructor has provided. You can learn more by reviewing this help file: https://support.pearson.com/getsupport/s/document-item?bundleId=Tries-vs-attempts-in-MyLab-and-Mastering&topicId=Tries_vs_Attempts.html&_LANG=enus.</p>

I'm not sure why someone didn't try adding the title just as the call to action stated when impersonating the customer.  I as able add the title when impersonating the customer. </p>

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> This is not a technical error - the school is applied to the instructors account based on what they've entered during registration. This can also be updated by you within the XL Admin tool if they do not have the proper school listed on their account.

Instructors can also use the Change option to select a different school if the course they are looking for does not show up.

The fact that there are variances in the school names - will need to be addressed locally to ensure the users all select the same school to share their assignments.

We have updated the list provided to Beverly Public School District - so all the users should see each others courses when selecting that option.</p>

<p><strong>FAD Reason:</strong> SUPPORT - this is #FAD and the student must remove Screencastify from Chrome by removing the extension. Removing extensions from Chrome can be done within the Chrome browser locally. Please assist the user with local technical support troubleshooting - if you are unable to do so you might refer the student to Respondus technical support.

Additional NO troubleshooting was done in 50302264 - that case is resolved because the student successfully accessed the test, I would assume after disabling the interfering application from Chrome, no action was taken by OCC since it was a local technical issue.</p>

<h3>Mastering Genetics - Submit zeros for students who did not start the assignment/Manage Incompletes</h3>

<p><strong>Questions/Comments/Notes to raise on CTS/Prod Support Call:</strong> We understand that this is FAD. This case originated from FS, where the FS team and FS Specialist explained to the EDU that students receive a score of zero due to the settings applied to the assignments, even though they have not completed them yet. Despite this explanation, the EDU insisted that there are some technical issues with the assignments or gradebook. As a result, the FS team decided to escalate the case to TS as the FS Specialist mentioned that they have seen similar case escalated to TS.

From the Tier 2 side, we've reviewed the support site before I escalate the case, though I was not able to mention that the EDU needs to uncheck the box each time they manage incompletes and point out that the EDU has the option to delete the zero scores. But we were able to inform the EDU that this is working as designed. We also provided the support site - https://help.pearsoncmg.com/xl/instructor/instructor_help/Content/submit_scores_incompletes.htm to the instructor for review; however, the EDU continues to insist that there is something wrong with their gradebook and assignment settings that is why we decided to escalate the case for further review.</p>

If they would like to delete 0 scores that they did not mean to give to specific students, they can click on those scores in the gradebook, select the dropdown next to the assignment on the next page, and delete the 0 score. However, please caution them that deleting is permanent; therefore, they want to be careful when doing this to avoid deleting any actual scores.</p>

1) Grade Sync Settings - This is where the instructor can set to sync grades to the LMS
2) Change Weights and Categories - Any assignments set to 'omit' will not send to the LMS.

#FAD - As per OneCRM KB - 000011507, the SOCKET_IM_12 error will generally occur if the LMS course is paired to a retail course (via Access Pearson) and the user is trying to launch it from a channel partner (VitalSource, Redshelf, WilloLab, Barnes and Noble, etc) tool, which is what is happening here from launch logs. CTS agent should be able to check this with student on call, if further training is needed please advise.</p>

As you also know XL logs student work in real time, with protections against loss of work in triplicate

Barring the unlikely event that the result was deleted by the instructor, which clearly doesn't seem to be the case here, this student never completed any work on these assignments as is reflected in the Gradebook. This is #FAD</p>

The code showing in the description of the ticket is: IBRA-THUNK-PILCH-FLYTE-ELVIS-GIBES which is an old access code for standalone eText which we don't offer anymore.

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> It appears that the student encountered a Late Penalty when they completed the work on September 3rd and 4th for these assignments on the MyLab side. The due dates have been extended for these assignments - so the student should relaunch them and save them one time. This should retrigger the grading aspect and recognize the new due date - which should eliminate the late penalty.

If this does not correct the issue - please provide a screenshot of what the LMS gradebook is showing.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> I can see that the mentioned assignments are listed as "status" : "RECEIVED" in the lineItemContainer collection in SOCKET DB, which means they have yet to be synced to the LMS.
The lineItemContainer collection in SOCKET DB is where all assignments are stored with the relevant information. As this still has "status" : "RECEIVED", meaning it hasn't been delivered, I checked the gradeSetting collection; which has the sync details, and can see that this is set to automatic, but specific assignments. The list doesn't include the assignments they have mentioned are missing from the LMS gradebook.

Please work with the instructor to select the assignments they wish to sync from the instructor dashboard > grade sync tab and then run the manual grade sync.</p>

This student is enrolled in MLM course id: hodgson35399 that has similar code (ITC 2016 - FALL 2024 90421) to course name name form student diagnostics, but this is non integrated course so would be accessible via mlm.pearson.com with Pearson username.

If instructor wants to use LMS integration:
1. they need to link to new copy (they can copy hodgson35399)
2. Ask students to join from LMS using the same Pearson username
3. Import student progress if needed form hodgson35399

There is nothing we can assist here - if instructor needs help with any of the steps above CTS or Faculty Support can help.</p>

It sounds like there is some confusion between tries and attempts here. The students are getting two tries and 10 attempts. Each time they click the check answer or final check button, that counts as a try. When they click try again, that counts as a new attempt, so they get two tries to answer the questions with each of the 10 attempts the instructor has provided. You can learn more by reviewing this help file: https://support.pearson.com/getsupport/s/document-item?bundleId=Tries-vs-attempts-in-MyLab-and-Mastering&topicId=Tries_vs_Attempts.html&_LANG=enus.</p>

Please ask the instructor to use the Import from other instructors based on their login name.

They will need to select Assignments from instructors at: Easybridge-SMS with this log-in: ffffffff5d2de614245ee1170173dd96_easybridge_ohccsd.

They will be presented with the two previous courses that they have taught. https://app.screencast.com/3470K8yFmhjMU</p>

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> FAD I'm not sure why this was escalated. Yes, the code was redeemed, but the call to action in Auth home library was to find a title to add. Sometimes auto provisioning of a title fails and customers will need to add the title themselves. I'm not sure why someone didn't try adding the title just as the call to action stated when impersonating the customer.  I as able add the title when impersonating the customer. </p>

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> This is not a technical error - the school is applied to the instructors account based on what they've entered during registration. This can also be updated by you within the XL Admin tool if they do not have the proper school listed on their account.

Instructors can also use the Change option to select a different school if the course they are looking for does not show up.

The fact that there are variances in the school names - will need to be addressed locally to ensure the users all select the same school to share their assignments.

We have updated the list provided to Beverly Public School District - so all the users should see each others courses when selecting that option.</p>

1) have the student enroll in the PREVIOUS section
2) once they have- the EDU can EXPORT the results
3) Once the export is complete have the student enroll in the NEW section

If the COURSES match exactly they can also use the IMPORT options to import the result.

This is straight from the help file so please make sure you're doing your due diligence before sending something up to engineering. https://support.pearson.com/getsupport/s/document-item?bundleId=revel-glp-instructor&topicId=Content/6-settings/how-settings-work.htm&_LANG=enus
Unlimited tries
If your course includes questions, such as code questions, with an unlimited number of possible answers, and you select the Unlimited tries option, students can answer the question as many times as they choose.
If, however, you select unlimited tries for assessments with questions that have a set number of answers, Revel limits the tries to the number of answers minus 1, as described above.</p>

<p><strong>Assigned to:</strong> Bryan Huffman</p>
<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> CTS -

The assignment cannot be deleted because there are results associated with the assignment in the course titled MATH 217 Summer 2024. If these scores have been exported or are no longer needed - you can delete the results for this assignment within this course - and that will allow the full assignment to be removed.

In regards to the Learning Aid changes - these can only be changed on assignments that students have not started. If there are current scores for these assignments - they would need to be deleted as well - the Learning Aids can then be updated - and then students can rework the assignment.

Please let me know if you have any questions.</p>

This case is very simply resolved as #FAD

This student has individual settings which require a password. This student should be referred to their instructor and this case should NOT have been escalated.

Please note that INDIVIDUAL students can have settings outside of the class settings.

<p><strong>Assigned to:</strong> Tana Regan</p>
<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> This is expected behavior in Mastering Platform Update. The original due date for the assignment was September 24th; however, the instructor applied individual student settings to the assignment (I suspect after the student completed it) to give this student a due date October 3rd. Unlike legacy Mastering, Mastering Platform Update does not automatically regrade student submissions when a new due date is applied. For the new settings to apply to the student's submission, the student needs to reopen the assignment. Since the new due date has passed, the instructor will need to push it out to any time in the future, and then the student will need to reopen and save the assignment before the new due date passes.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> Hi Melissa,

Now that Auto Grade sync is turned on this should let the grades sync right when they are completed by the student and should also stop these "false" late submissions that are only showing on the Canvas side as the grade is showing up correctly on the Revel side.  Unfortunately to my knowledge there is no way to retroactively fix the Canvas gradebook but that would be a question for the school Canvas admin or Canvas support.  If this is still happening on future assignments that haven't been completed yet  and the grades sync automatically please give us one student and the exercise so that we can look into this.  The Revel and Learning Management System team are aware that submission time aren't sent to the LMS and the sync time is what is view by the Learning Management System as the "submit time" and can cause this issue.  Unfortunately I do not have an ETA on when this will be changed but it is something the teams are working diligently on.</p>
<p><strong>Missing Info:</strong> #INFO - for grade sync issues, we need specifics; I.E. student and assignment that is marked as late in the LMS. otherwise it is very easy to miss the issue completely.</p>

2) Parts of the etext are missing for hours at a time. Students will, for example, be reading chapter 2, and parts of the etext will disappear from view, while others stay visible. This will resolve a few hours later, but then another part might disappear. At least 30 students in my class reported on this today.
- we would need to try to replicate this so we would need exact steps to replicate. Also a short video from a student having this happen would be helpful

3) Students are completing the quizzes but then a blank screen appears, and they are told they are receiving a 0 out of 21 or however much the quiz was worth.
-We would need a screenshot of what the student is seeing along with the course ID, assignment name, and assessment name.

Please make sure any screenshots are not cropped

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> CTS -

There was not a specific assignment title offered in this case. The student shows they have two instructor provided 0's in the gradebook. For both of these assignments - if you review the Item Analysis - you can see the student did not attempt any of the questions within either assignment. When the instructor ran the manage incomplete functionality - the assignment was given a 0.

If the student attempted to work on these after the 0 was provided - it would have been in review mode and nothing would have been logged as the score was already provided.

Thanks
Bryan</p>

Removing extensions from Chrome can be done within the Chrome browser locally. Please assist the user with local technical support troubleshooting - if you are unable to do so you might refer the student to Respondus technical support.

Additional NO troubleshooting was done in 50302264 - that case is resolved because the student successfully accessed the test, I would assume after disabling the interfering application from Chrome, no action was taken by OCC since it was a local technical issue.</p>

<h3>Mastering Genetics - Submit zeros for students who did not start the assignment/Manage Incompletes</h3>

<p><strong>Questions/Comments/Notes to raise on CTS/Prod Support Call:</strong> We understand that this is FAD. This case originated from FS, where the FS team and FS Specialist explained to the EDU that students receive a score of zero due to the settings applied to the assignments, even though they have not completed them yet. Despite this explanation, the EDU insisted that there are some technical issues with the assignments or gradebook. As a result, the FS team decided to escalate the case to TS as the FS Specialist mentioned that they have seen similar case escalated to TS.

From the Tier 2 side, we've reviewed the support site before I escalate the case, though I was not able to mention that the EDU needs to uncheck the box each time they manage incompletes and point out that the EDU has the option to delete the zero scores. But we were able to inform the EDU that this is working as designed. We also provided the support site - https://help.pearsoncmg.com/xl/instructor/instructor_help/Content/submit_scores_incompletes.htm to the instructor for review; however, the EDU continues to insist that there is something wrong with their gradebook and assignment settings that is why we decided to escalate the case for further review.</p>

<p><strong>FAD Reason.:</strong> This is functioning as designed. The box needs to be unchecked each time the instructor manages incompletes: https://help.pearsoncmg.com/xl/instructor/instructor_help/Content/submit_scores_incompletes.htm. If they would like to delete 0 scores that they did not mean to give to specific students, they can click on those scores in the gradebook, select the dropdown next to the assignment on the next page, and delete the 0 score. However, please caution them that deleting is permanent; therefore, they want to be careful when doing this to avoid deleting any actual scores.</p>

This is FAD.  This student needs to contact their instructor to see where the link to the course was placed in the LMS course.  We don't control where that link was put but I see other students have joined the course ID 66c4aa530f531b682da53421 that you provided.</p>

The code showing in the description of the ticket is: IBRA-THUNK-PILCH-FLYTE-ELVIS-GIBES which is an old access code for standalone eText which we don't offer anymore.

Once the Omit Results is turned off those items will flow into the "Instructor Self-Service" link area > Grade Sync where sync can then be confirmed for all items. Once the graded items flow to the ISS > Grade Sync area, and the applicable items have been marked for sync and they read "Enabled", those will then appear in the D2L gradebook.

From the Tier 2 side, we've reviewed the student account before I escalate the case, however, we failed to thoroughly check the instructor's account.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> This is functioning as designed. The instructor has the Course Home set to "hidden." Please reach out to the instructor directly and let them know that students are not able to access the Course Home when they open the course because it has been set to hidden. I'm not sure if they intended to do this or if it was an accident, but they can unhide it by going to Manage course>Edit Course Menu> and clicking the toggle.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> It appears that the student encountered a Late Penalty when they completed the work on September 3rd and 4th for these assignments on the MyLab side. The due dates have been extended for these assignments - so the student should relaunch them and save them one time. This should retrigger the grading aspect and recognize the new due date - which should eliminate the late penalty.

If this does not correct the issue - please provide a screenshot of what the LMS gradebook is showing.</p>

The lineItemContainer collection in SOCKET DB is where all assignments are stored with the relevant information.

The list doesn't include the assignments they have mentioned are missing from the LMS gradebook.

This student is enrolled in MLM course id: hodgson35399 that has similar code (ITC 2016 - FALL 2024 90421) to course name name form student diagnostics, but this is non integrated course so would be accessible via mlm.pearson.com with Pearson username.

If instructor wants to use LMS integration:
1. they need to link to new copy (they can copy hodgson35399)
2. Ask students to join from LMS using the same Pearson username
3. Import student progress if needed form hodgson35399

It sounds like there is some confusion between tries and attempts here. The students are getting two tries and 10 attempts. Each time they click the check answer or final check button, that counts as a try. When they click try again, that counts as a new attempt, so they get two tries to answer the questions with each of the 10 attempts the instructor has provided. You can learn more by reviewing this help file: https://support.pearson.com/getsupport/s/document-item?bundleId=Tries-vs-attempts-in-MyLab-and-Mastering&topicId=Tries_vs_Attempts.html&_LANG=enus.</p>

<p><strong>Assigned to:</strong> Bryan Huffman</p>
<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> As noted in the FTP file - the instructor has two accounts within MathXLForSchool. This is the biggest indicator that the instructor is looking at the wrong account to import their assignments from as the courses appear to be on the second account.

Please ask the instructor to use the Import from other instructors based on their login name.

They will need to select Assignments from instructors at: Easybridge-SMS with this log-in: ffffffff5d2de614245ee1170173dd96_easybridge_ohccsd.

They will be presented with the two previous courses that they have taught. https://app.screencast.com/3470K8yFmhjMU</p>

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> FAD I'm not sure why this was escalated. Yes, the code was redeemed, but the call to action in Auth home library was to find a title to add. Sometimes auto provisioning of a title fails and customers will need to add the title themselves. I'm not sure why someone didn't try adding the title just as the call to action stated when impersonating the customer.  I as able add the title when impersonating the customer. </p>

<p><strong>Resolution notes:</strong> This is not a technical error - the school is applied to the instructors account based on what they've entered during registration. This can also be updated by you within the XL Admin tool if they do not have the proper school listed on their account.

Instructors can also use the Change option to select a different school if the course they are looking for does not show up.

The fact that there are variances in the school names - will need to be addressed locally to ensure the users all select the same school to share their assignments.

We have updated the list provided to Beverly Public School District - so all the users should see each others courses when selecting that option.</p>

Please work with the student on troublshooting their issue.  It could be security software or even their internet connection but this isn't a product issue.</p>
