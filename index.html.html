      <td>FAD I'm not sure why this was escalated. Yes, the code was redeemed, but the call to action in Auth home library was to find a title to add. Sometimes auto provisioning of a title fails and customers will need to add the title themselves. I'm not sure why someone didn't try adding the title just as the call to action stated when impersonating the customer.  I as able add the title when impersonating the customer.</td>

      <td>This is not a technical error - the school is applied to the instructors account based on what they've entered during registration. This can also be updated by you within the XL Admin tool if they do not have the proper school listed on their account.\n\nInstructors can also use the Change option to select a different school if the course they are looking for does not show up.\n\nThe fact that there are variances in the school names - will need to be addressed locally to ensure the users all select the same school to share their assignments.\n\nWe have updated the list provided to Beverly Public School District - so all the users should see each others courses when selecting that option.</td>
